This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with both a basic and a sorted doubly linked list. It allows you to add, remove, retrieve, and access elements within a linked list structure. The GUI also includes iterator functionality to move through the lists, as well as integrated support for comparing elements when working with the sorted version of the list. The underlying data structures (BasicDoubleLinkedList and SortedDoubleLinkedList) are complemented by this interactive JavaFX application, making it easier to visualize operations and confirm their correctness.
